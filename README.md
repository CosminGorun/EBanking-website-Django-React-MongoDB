<p>My contribution to this project involved creating login procedures, where a user can log in with a username and password if they have one or can create an account. If the user forgets their password, they can recover it using the email associated with the account.</p>

<p>When creating an account, a valid email address must be provided for account recovery. To validate it, a verification email is sent to the provided address, and the account is created only if the code sent is entered correctly.</p>

<p>For password recovery, you only need to enter the username, after which an email will be sent to the address associated with the account. Once the code is entered, you will just need to set a new password.</p>
